                    <strong>Academic Background:</strong> I started out in surgical
                    technology but after a few semesters doing clinicals, (the smell of
                    burning flesh, blood and the OR smell) I decided it wasn't for me, so
                    I’m now completing my associates in IT- Full stack.
